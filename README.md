# Summary

I'm working on a programming project based on Shadow Dark rules. It's a combat simulator aptly named "How Dark?".

# Assumptions & Key Points

1. No surprise (yet?)
2. All creatures in near distance
3. Mobs randomly choose a target Players focus fire
4. Heal spells only go off if someone is hurt
5. If a creature can do one of many thing randomly choose
6. AOE spells randomly target a number of creatures... for example Burning Hands D4 targets
7. Dying, unconscious, paralyzed, fear, sleeping, engulfed conditions implemented
8. All simple weapons implemented
9. Magic Missile, Burning Hands, Sleep, Cure Wounds, Shield of Faith, Turn Undead implemented so far.

# Example Simulation Results
4 level 1 characters against 1 Ogre... 1,000 fights...

`Group 1: wins=456, winsWithDeath=123`

`Group 2: wins=544, winsWithDeath=0`
